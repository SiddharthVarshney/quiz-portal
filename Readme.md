Build on nodejs uses PostgreSQL database and cloudinary as image cloud.
> NodeJS is awesome!! 
### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup NoseJS
* Setup POstgresSQL
* clone the repo
* Switch to up branch
* run `$ npm install`
* run `$ cp .env.sample .env`
* add necessary variables to .env file
* database schema is present in schema/schema.sql
* fire up the node server `$ npm start`
## and up you go on 3000!!

* the current directory structure follows core MVC framework (good for practice :smile:)

## `rm -rf`

added this command to remove all uploaded image from uploads/ folder to keep site light as all images are stored on cloudinary
